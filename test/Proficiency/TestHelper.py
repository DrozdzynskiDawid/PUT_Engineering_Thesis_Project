    text = """Cosmic space, often referred to as outer space, is the vast, seemingly infinite expanse that stretches 
    beyond Earth’s atmosphere, filled with mysteries, wonders, and celestial phenomena. It is a place where time and 
    distance take on unimaginable proportions, with distances measured in light-years, the distance light travels in 
    one year—nearly six trillion miles. Within this enormous vacuum lie billions of galaxies, each containing 
    billions of stars, planets, and other astronomical objects.

Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is just one among these countless galaxies, a swirling spiral of stars and dust stretching 
over 100,000 light-years across. It is home to our solar system, where our Sun—a massive star—sits at the center, 
exerting its gravitational pull over planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. The planets, like Mercury, Venus, Earth, 
and Jupiter, orbit the Sun in elliptical paths, each with its own unique characteristics. Earth, the third planet 
from the Sun, is unique in its ability to support life as we know it, thanks to its atmosphere, water, and distance 
from the Sun.

Beyond our solar system lies the interstellar space, filled with gas and dust, where stars are born in stellar 
nurseries called nebulae. These immense clouds of gas and dust eventually collapse under gravity, igniting nuclear 
fusion and giving birth to new stars. Some stars burn brightly for millions or billions of years before dying in 
spectacular ways—like exploding in supernovae—scattering elements across the cosmos, elements that one day may form 
new stars, planets, or even life. Black holes, remnants of massive stars that have collapsed under their own gravity, 
lurk throughout the galaxy, with gravity so intense that not even light can escape their pull.

In the farthest reaches of space, the universe is expanding, a discovery first made by Edwin Hubble in the 20th 
century. Galaxies are moving away from each other, a phenomenon explained by the Big Bang Theory, which suggests that 
the universe began as a singular point some 13.8 billion years ago. From that moment of intense energy, space itself 
began expanding, and continues to do so today. This ongoing expansion raises questions about the universe's ultimate 
fate—will it continue expanding forever, or will it one day contract back into itself in what some theorize as the 
Big Crunch?

The dark side of the cosmos is equally fascinating. Dark matter and dark energy, mysterious substances that don't 
emit or reflect light, make up most of the universe’s mass and energy, yet remain invisible and poorly understood. 
They govern the universe’s expansion and structure, yet elude direct observation.

Space is also home to phenomena that challenge our understanding of physics, such as pulsars, rapidly rotating 
neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation, and quasars, incredibly bright and distant objects 
powered by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies.

Astronomers use powerful telescopes, both ground-based and in space, to peer deep into the cosmos, seeking to 
understand these vast distances and enigmatic forces. Space exploration, led by organizations like NASA and private 
companies such as SpaceX, has taken humanity beyond Earth’s atmosphere, with missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond, 
slowly unlocking the secrets of our solar system and the wider universe.

Cosmic space, though cold, dark, and empty in many ways, is filled with the elements that shape life and existence. 
Every atom in our body was once part of a star, and in a profound sense, we are made of stardust. The vast, 
silent stretches of space invite curiosity, humility, and awe, as we seek to understand our place in this grand 
cosmic web. From the smallest particle to the largest galaxy, the universe is an intricate, dynamic system, 
bound by the laws of physics and yet filled with mysteries waiting to be uncovered."""
